# Functional Requirements By Phase

### **Essential for MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**

The MVP is the simplest version of your platform that allows it to be functional and usable by your target audience. The goal is to release it quickly to validate your core idea with actual users and gather feedback.

**Examples:**

1. **User Registration and Authentication** :

* Why? The first step for any personalized platform. You want users to have their own space where they can upload, track, and manage their algorithms.

1. **Basic UI for Uploading and Listing Algorithms** :

* Why? The core functionality. Developers need to upload their algorithms, and consumers need to see available algorithms.

1. **Basic Search Functionality** :

* Why? With multiple algorithms available, users need a way to find specific ones that match their requirements.

### **Next-phase:**

Once the MVP is out and you've gathered initial feedback, you can focus on enhancing the platform with more advanced features that improve user experience or address additional user needs.

**Examples:**

1. **Backtesting Functionality for Uploaded Algorithms** :

* Why? Users will want to know the past performance of an algorithm before they use it. This increases trust and can be a deciding factor for adoption.

1. **Rating and Review System for Algorithms** :

* Why? It helps users gauge the effectiveness and reliability of an algorithm based on community feedback. It also helps quality algorithms to get recognized.

1. **User Profiles with Trading and Upload Histories** :

* Why? To give users a summary of their activities, and allow other users to see the track record of an algorithm developer.

1. **Notifications and Alerts** :

* Why? Users can be notified about updates on algorithms, new reviews, etc., enhancing engagement with the platform.

### **Long-term:**

These are features that would be great to have but are either not essential for the platform's core functionality, may require significant resources, or are based on anticipated future needs.

**Examples:**

1. **Real-time Trade Simulations** :

* Why? Before committing real money, users might want to see how an algorithm performs in real-time market conditions without actual trading.

1. **Integration with External Trading Platforms** :

* Why? To allow users to directly implement algorithmic trades on their preferred platforms, enhancing the utility of the algorithms.

1. **Machine Learning Enhanced Search and Recommendations** :

* Why? As the platform grows and hosts numerous algorithms, ML can help users discover new or more effective algorithms based on their profile and preferences.

1. **Marketplace for Premium Algorithms** :

* Why? To monetize the platform and allow developers to earn from their top-performing algorithms.

1. **Community Features like Forums or Chats** :

* Why? To build a community where users can discuss algorithms, trading strategies, and provide mutual support.
